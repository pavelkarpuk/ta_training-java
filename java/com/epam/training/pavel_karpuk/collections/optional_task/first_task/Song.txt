1. I walk a lonely road
2. The only one that I have ever known
3. Don't know where it goes
4. But it's home to me, and I walk alone
5. I walk this empty street
6. On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
7. Where the city sleeps
8. And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
9. I walk alone, I walk alone
10. I walk alone, I walk alone
